The engine reaches normal oper-\\nating temperature more quickly, which\\ndecreases consumption and reduces\\nemissions.\\nAlso remember to always dispose of environ-\\nmentally hazardous waste, such as batteries\\nand oil, in an environmentally safe manner.\\nConsult a workshop in the event of uncertainty\\nabout how this type of waste should be dis-\\ncarded - an authorised Volvo workshop is rec-\\nommended.\\nEfficient emission control\\nYour Volvo is manufactured following the con-\\ncept \"Clean inside and out\" – a concept that\\nencompasses a clean interior environment as\\nwell as highly efficient emission control. In\\nmany cases the exhaust emissions are well\\nbelow the applicable standards.\\nClean air in the passenger\\ncompartment\\nAn air filter helps prevent dust and pollen\\nentering the passenger compartment via the\\nair intake.\\nThe Interior Air Quality System (IAQS)*\\nensures that the incoming air is cleaner than\\nthe air in the traffic outside.\\nThe system cleans the air in the passenger\\ncompartment from contaminants such as par-\\nticles, hydrocarbons, nitrous oxides and\\nground-level ozone. If the outside air is conta-\\nminated then the air intake is closed and the\\nair is recirculated. Such a situation may arise\\nin heavy traffic, queues and tunnels for exam-\\nple.\\nIAQS is a part of the Clean Zone Interior Pack-\\nage (CZIP)*, which also includes a function\\nthat allows the fan to start when the car is\\nunlocked with the remote control key.\\nInterior\\nThe material used in the interior of a Volvo is\\ncarefully selected and has been tested in order\\nto be pleasant and comfortable. Some of the\\ndetails are hand-made, such as the seams of\\nthe steering wheel that are sewn by hand. The\\ninterior is monitored in order not to emit\\nstrong odours or substances that cause dis-\\ncomfort in the event of e.g. high heat and\\nbright light.\\nVolvo workshops and the environment\\nRegular maintenance creates the conditions\\nfor a long service life and low fuel consump-\\ntion for your car. In this way you also contrib-\\nute to a cleaner environment. When Volvo\\'s\\nworkshops are entrusted with the service and\\nmaintenance of your car it becomes part of\\nVolvo\\'s system. Volvo makes clear demands\\nregarding the way in which workshop prem-\\nises shall be designed in order to prevent spills\\nand discharges into the environment. The\\nworkshop staff have the knowledge and the\\ntools required to guarantee good environmen-\\ntal care.\\nRecycling\\nSince Volvo works from a life cycle perspec-\\ntive, it is also important that the car is recycled\\nin an environmentally sound manner. Almost\\nall of the car can be recycled.

It is important to know\\nabout all of the function's applications and lim-\\nitations in order to safely use all of the advan-\\ntages.\\nThe Pilot Assist function is primarily intended\\nfor use on motorways and similar major roads\\nwhere it can contribute to more comfortable\\ndriving and a more relaxed driving experience.\\nThe driver selects the desired speed and a\\ntime interval to the vehicle ahead. Pilot Assist\\nscans the distance to the vehicle ahead and\\nthe lane's side markings on the road surface\\nusing the camera unit. The preset time interval\\nis maintained with automatic speed adjust-\\nment whilst the steering assistance helps to\\nposition the car in the lane.\\nIf the cornering support* function is activated,\\nthis may also affect the speed of the car.\\nPilot Assist regulates the speed with accelera-\\ntion and braking. It is normal for the brakes to\\nemit a low sound when they are being used to\\nadjust the speed.\\nPilot Assist strives to:\\n•\\nregulate the speed smoothly. In situations\\nthat demand sudden braking the driver\\nmust brake himself/herself. This applies in\\ncases of large speed differences or if the\\ncar in front brakes suddenly.

This\\nalso takes place if the speed of the vehicle\\nahead increases and exceeds the stored\\nspeed.\\nPosition of the car in the lane\\nWhen Pilot Assist helps to steer, it attempts to\\nplace the car halfway between the visible lane\\nmarkings. For a smoother drive, it is a good\\nidea to allow the car to find a good position.\\nThe driver can always adjust the position him/\\nherself by increasing the steering input. It is\\nimportant that the driver checks to make sure\\nthe car is positioned safely in the lane.\\nIf Pilot Assist does not position the car in an\\nappropriate way in the lane, it is recom-\\nmended to turn Pilot Assist off or switch to\\nadaptive cruise control*.\\n67 This function can be either standard or optional, depending on market.\\n\", metadata={'source': 'https://az685612.vo.msecnd.net/pdfs/20w17/XC60_OwnersManual_MY21_en-GB_TP32005/XC60_OwnersManual_MY21_en-GB_TP32005.pdf', 'file_path': 'https://az685612.vo.msecnd.net/pdfs/20w17/XC60_OwnersManual_MY21_en-GB_TP32005/XC60_OwnersManual_MY21_en-GB_TP32005.pdf', 'page': 330, 'total_pages': 720, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': '', 'producer': 'GPL Ghostscript 9.06', 'creationDate': \"D:20200421104728+02'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20200421104728+02'00'\", 'trapped': ''}), Document(page_content=\"||\\nDRIVER SUPPORT\\n330\\nSteering assistance\\nThe current status of steering\\nassistance is indicated by the\\ncolour of the steering wheel's\\nsymbol:\\n• GREEN steering wheel indi-\\ncates active steering assis-\\ntance\\n• GREY steering wheel (as in illustration) indi-\\ncates deactivated steering assistance.\\nPilot Assist steering assistance takes into\\naccount the speed of the preceding car and\\nthe lane markings.

It is also\\nimportant for the driver always to carry on\\nbeing active and alert when driving as Pilot\\nAssist is unable to read all situations and the\\nfunction may toggle between off and on with-\\nout prior warning.\\nIf Pilot Assist detects that the\\ndriver does not keep his/her\\nhands on the steering wheel,\\nthe system gives a warning\\nwith a symbol and text mes-\\nsage in the driver display in\\norder to prompt the driver to\\nactively steer the car.\\nIf the driver's hands still cannot be detected\\non the steering wheel after a few seconds, the\\nprompt to actively steer the car is repeated,\\nsupplemented by an acoustic signal.\\nIf Pilot Assist cannot detect the driver's hands\\non the steering wheel after a further few sec-\\nonds, the warning signal becomes intensive\\nand the steering function is deactivated. Pilot\\nAssist must then be restarted using the steer-\\ning wheel button \\n.\\n\", metadata={'source': 'https://az685612.vo.msecnd.net/pdfs/20w17/XC60_OwnersManual_MY21_en-GB_TP32005/XC60_OwnersManual_MY21_en-GB_TP32005.pdf', 'file_path': 'https://az685612.vo.msecnd.net/pdfs/20w17/XC60_OwnersManual_MY21_en-GB_TP32005/XC60_OwnersManual_MY21_en-GB_TP32005.pdf', 'page': 331, 'total_pages': 720, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': '', 'producer': 'GPL Ghostscript 9.06', 'creationDate': \"D:20200421104728+02'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20200421104728+02'00'\", 'trapped': ''}), Document(page_content=\"DRIVER SUPPORT\\n}}\\n* Option/accessory. 331\\nWARNING\\n•\\nThe function is supplementary driver\\nsupport intended to facilitate driving\\nand make it safer – it cannot handle all\\nsituations in all traffic, weather and\\nroad conditions.\\n•\\nThe driver is advised to read all sec-\\ntions in the Owner's Manual that relate\\nto this function to learn about factors\\nsuch as its limitations and what the\\ndriver should be aware of before using\\nthe system.\\n•\\nDriver support functions are not a sub-\\nstitute for the driver's attention and\\njudgement.

Snaking normally\\noccurs at high speeds. However, there is a risk\\nof it occurring at lower speeds if the trailer is\\noverloaded or the load is improperly distrib-\\nuted, e.g. too far back.\\nIn order for snaking to occur, there must be a\\ntriggering factor, e.g.:\\n•\\nCar with trailer subjected to a sudden and\\npowerful side wind.\\n•\\nCar with trailer drives on an uneven road\\nsurface or in a pothole.\\n•\\nSweeping steering wheel movements.\\nIf snaking has started, it could be difficult or\\neven impossible to suppress. This makes the\\ncar/trailer combination difficult to control and\\nthere is a risk that you could, for example, end\\nup in the wrong lane or leave the carriageway.\\nTrailer stability assist function\\nThe trailer stability assist function continually\\nmonitors the car's movements, particularly lat-\\neral movements. If snaking is detected, the\\nfront wheels are individually braked. This\\nserves to stabilise the car/trailer combination.\\nThis is often enough to help the driver regain\\ncontrol of the car.\\nIf snaking is not eliminated the first time that\\ntrailer stability assist intervenes, the car/trailer\\ncombination is braked with all wheels and\\nengine power is reduced. Once snaking has\\nbeen gradually suppressed and the car/trailer\\ncombination is stable once again, the system\\nstops regulating and the driver once again has\\nfull control of the car.\\nNOTE\\nThe stability function is deactivated if the\\ndriver chooses to activate ESC Sport\\nMode via the menu system in the centre\\ndisplay.\\nTrailer stability assist may fail to intervene if\\nthe driver uses severe steering wheel move-\\nments to try to rectify the snaking because in\\nsuch a situation the system cannot determine\\nwhether it is the trailer or the driver causing\\nthe snaking.\\nWhen Trailer Stability Assist\\n(TSA) is operating, the ESC\\nsymbol flashes in the driver\\ndisplay.\\nNOTE\\nRetrofitting a towbar requires an update of\\nthe car's software, contact a Volvo dealer.\\nRelated information\\n•\\nDriving with a trailer (p. 494)\\n•\\nElectronic stability control (p. 295)\\n35 Trailer Stability Assist\\n36 Electronic Stability Control\\n\", metadata={'source': 'https://az685612.vo.msecnd.net/pdfs/20w17/XC60_OwnersManual_MY21_en-GB_TP32005/XC60_OwnersManual_MY21_en-GB_TP32005.pdf', 'file_path': 'https://az685612.vo.msecnd.net/pdfs/20w17/XC60_OwnersManual_MY21_en-GB_TP32005/XC60_OwnersManual_MY21_en-GB_TP32005.pdf', 'page': 497, 'total_pages': 720, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': '', 'producer': 'GPL Ghostscript 9.06', 'creationDate': \"D:20200421104728+02'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20200421104728+02'00'\", 'trapped': ''}), Document(page_content=\"STARTING AND DRIVING\\n* Option/accessory. 497\\nChecking trailer lamps\\nWhen connecting a trailer - check that all the\\ntrailer lamps work before departure.\\nDirection indicators and brake lights\\non the trailer\\nIf one or more of the trailer's direction indica-\\ntors or brake light bulbs is broken, the driver\\ndisplay shows a symbol and a message.

In the event of changing\\ntyres, it is therefore important that the new\\ntyres also have this marking in order for the\\ncar's driving characteristics, comfort and fuel\\nconsumption to be maintained.\\nNew tyres\\nTyres are perishable. After a few years they\\nbegin to harden at the same time as the fric-\\ntion capacity/characteristics gradually deterio-\\nrate. For this reason, aim to get as fresh tyres\\nas possible when you replace them. This is\\nespecially important with regard to winter\\ntyres. The last four digits in the sequence\\nmean the week and year of manufacture. This\\nis the tyre's DOT marking (Department of\\nTransportation), and this is stated with four\\ndigits, for example 0717.

Tyres age and decompose, even\\nif they are hardly ever or never used. The func-\\ntion can therefore be affected. This applies to\\nall tyres that are stored for future use.

Tyres are considered cold when\\nthey have the same temperature as the sur-\\nrounding air. This temperature is normally\\nreached when the car has been parked for at\\nleast three hours.\\nAfter having driven approximately 1.6 km\\n(1 mile) these tyres are considered as warm. If\\nyou have to drive further than this to inflate the\\ntyres, first check and record the tyre pressure\\nand inflate to a suitable tyre pressure when\\nyou arrive at the pump.\\nWhen the outside temperature changes, the\\ntyre pressure also changes. A decrease in tem-\\nperature of 10 degrees causes the tyre pres-\\nsure to decrease 1 psi (7 kPa). Check the tyre\\npressure regularly and adjust to the correct\\npressure, which is specified on the car's tyre\\ninformation decal or certification label.\\nIf you check the tyre pressure when the tyres\\nare warm then you must never release any air.\\nThe tyres are warm due to driving and it is nor-\\nmal for the pressure to increase above the rec-\\nommended pressure for cold tyres. A warm\\ntyre with tyre pressure equal to or below the\\nrecommendation for cold tyres may have a\\npressure that is far too low.\\n\", metadata={'source': 'https://az685612.vo.msecnd.net/pdfs/20w17/XC60_OwnersManual_MY21_en-GB_TP32005/XC60_OwnersManual_MY21_en-GB_TP32005.pdf', 'file_path': 'https://az685612.vo.msecnd.net/pdfs/20w17/XC60_OwnersManual_MY21_en-GB_TP32005/XC60_OwnersManual_MY21_en-GB_TP32005.pdf', 'page': 577, 'total_pages': 720, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': '', 'producer': 'GPL Ghostscript 9.06', 'creationDate': \"D:20200421104728+02'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20200421104728+02'00'\", 'trapped': ''}), Document(page_content='WHEELS AND TYRES\\n}}\\n* Option/accessory. 577\\nRelated information\\n•\\nAdjusting tyre pressure (p. 577)\\n•\\nRecommended tyre pressure (p. 578)\\n•\\nTyre pressure monitoring system*\\n(p. 579)\\n•\\nTyres (p. 572)\\nAdjusting tyre pressure\\nTyre pressure decreases over time, this is a\\nnatural phenomenon.

If the tyre pressure is too\\nlow, the tyre's diameter is changed and, as a\\nresult, so is its rotation speed. By comparing\\nthe tyres with each other the system can\\ndetermine whether one or more tyres have\\npressure that is too low.\\nGeneral information on the tyre monitoring\\nsystem\\nIn the information below, the tyre monitoring\\nsystem is referred to generically as TPMS.\\nEach tyre, including the spare tyre*, should be\\nchecked once a month. When checking, the\\ntyre should be cold and have the air pressure\\nrecommended by the car manufacturer speci-\\nfied on the tyre pressure label or in the tyre\\npressure table. If the car has tyres of a differ-\\nent size than that recommended by the manu-\\nfacturer, find out what the correct air pressure\\nlevel is for these.\\nAs an extra safety feature, the car is equipped\\nwith a tyre pressure monitoring system\\n(TPMS), which shows when the air pressure in\\none or more tyres is too low. When the indica-\\ntor symbol for low air pressure is lit, stop and\\ncheck the tyres as soon as possible and inflate\\nto the correct air pressure.\\nDriving with tyres that have tyre pressure that\\nis too low may cause the tyre to overheat,\\nwhich can cause a tyre failure. Low tyre pres-\\nsure also reduces fuel efficiency as well as tyre\\nservice life, and can affect car handling and\\nstopping ability. Note that TPMS does not\\nreplace regular tyre maintenance. It is the driv-\\ner's responsibility to maintain correct tyre\\npressure, even if the limit for low tyre pressure\\nhas not been reached so that the indicator\\nsymbol illuminates.\\nThe car is also equipped with a TPMS system\\nfault indicator, which indicates when the sys-\\ntem is not functioning correctly. The TPMS\\nsystem fault indicator is combined with the\\nindicator symbol for low tyre pressure. When\\nthe system detects a fault, the symbol in the\\ndriver display will flash for about one minute\\nand then remain illuminated. This procedure\\nwill be repeated when the car is started until\\nthe fault has been rectified. When the symbol\\nis illuminated, the system's ability to detect or\\nwarn of low tyre pressure may be affected.\\nA TPMS system fault can occur for several\\nreasons, such as after changing to a spare\\ntyre, or changing tyres or wheels that prevent\\nTPMS from functioning correctly.\\nAlways check the indicator symbol for TPMS\\nafter changing one or more tyres in order to\\nensure the new tyre or wheel is working cor-\\nrectly with TPMS.\\nTo bear in mind\\n•\\nAlways save a new tyre pressure in the\\nsystem after changing a wheel or adjust-\\ning tyre pressure.\\n•\\nIf you change to tyres of a different size to\\nthe ones fitted at the factory, the system\\nmust be reset by storing a new tyre pres-\\nsure for these tyres to avoid false warn-\\nings.\\n•\\nIf a spare wheel* is used, it is possible that\\nthe tyre pressure monitoring system does\\n3 Indirect Tyre Pressure Monitoring System (ITPMS)\\n\", metadata={'source': 'https://az685612.vo.msecnd.net/pdfs/20w17/XC60_OwnersManual_MY21_en-GB_TP32005/XC60_OwnersManual_MY21_en-GB_TP32005.pdf', 'file_path': 'https://az685612.vo.msecnd.net/pdfs/20w17/XC60_OwnersManual_MY21_en-GB_TP32005/XC60_OwnersManual_MY21_en-GB_TP32005.pdf', 'page': 580, 'total_pages': 720, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': '', 'producer': 'GPL Ghostscript 9.06', 'creationDate': \"D:20200421104728+02'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20200421104728+02'00'\", 'trapped': ''}), Document(page_content=\"||\\nWHEELS AND TYRES\\n* Option/accessory.\\n580\\nnot work correctly due to the differences\\nbetween the wheels.\\n•\\nThe system does not replace the need for\\nregular tyre inspection and maintenance.\\n•\\nIt is not possible to switch off the tyre\\npressure monitoring system.\\nWARNING\\n•\\nIncorrect tyre pressure may lead to tyre\\nfailure, which could result in the driver\\nlosing control of the car.\\n•\\nThe system cannot indicate sudden\\ntyre damage in advance.\\nRelated information\\n•\\nRecommended tyre pressure (p. 578)\\n•\\nSee tyre pressure status in the centre dis-\\nplay* (p. 581)\\n•\\nAction in the event of warning for low tyre\\npressure (p. 582)\\n•\\nSaving a new reference value for tyre pres-\\nsure monitoring* (p. 580)\\n•\\nMessages for tyre pressure monitoring*\\n(p. 583)\\nSaving a new reference value for\\ntyre pressure monitoring*\\nIn order for the system for tyre pressure\\nmonitoring4 to work correctly, a reference\\nvalue for the tyre pressure must be saved.\\nThis must take place every time the tyres are\\nchanged or the tyre pressure is changed so\\nthat the system can warn about low pressure\\ncorrectly.\\nFor example, when driving with a heavy load\\nor at high speed above 160 km/h (100 mph),\\nthe tyre pressure should be adjusted in\\naccordance with Volvo's recommended tyre\\npressure values.

The standard is based on four differ-\\nent drive cycle profiles.
