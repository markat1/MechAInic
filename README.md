# Project idea 
making a RAG system for mechanics and car product managers

# Problem? 
Nowadays a mechanic has to handle lot of different vehicles, which requires knowledge about different parts of different cars.

Special knowledge would require the mecanic to sit down and research deeper in car repair manuals just to retrieve information in need of succeed in solving  a particular problem with a particular car. That would require hours in just researching and not do any repairing.
Make use of a rag system and assistant/tooling 

# Why? 

It would be much easier if the mecanic could use an LLM model that has a RAG system to prompt in with questions about certain vehicles.

This RAG would then be able to fetch the context from a vector database that has chunked embeddings from multiple car manufacturers  repair manuals.

If the mecanic also needs to know which distributor has particular needed parts it can ask the rag system which will then use an assistant  plus tools to provide back an answer that it will fetch from particular car par manufacturers, which make specific parts for specific cars.

# Audience? 

So the audience here would be the mecanic that spends lots of time in preparation for handling particular complex issues, that also requires mecanic to not do the practical part while studying.
Potential solution? Make a Rag system that would contain proper context for mecanics to use on the spot while trying to fix or need specific knowledge about a certain car. Then use assistant plus tooling in order to get some sense of what manifacturers can provide parts for the particular car in need of parts.
